title: Computing a multiplicity with a type family and GADT is not supported
---

This example of an interaction between multiplicities and type equalities was discussed in the[GHC proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/111#issuecomment-438125526) which introduced linear types.
There is no theoretical problem with this program, but the type inference mechanisms that GHC currently uses cannot typecheck it.

    GHC bug #19517: GHC currently does not support programs using GADTs or type families to witness equality of multiplicities
