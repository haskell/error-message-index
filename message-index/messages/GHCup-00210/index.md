title: GPG verify failed
summary: GHCup tried to verify the authenticity of a software channel using GPG, but failed
severity: error
introduced: 0.1.19.0
---

GHCup receives information about available Haskell tools through a metadata file in YAML format that describes where to find the tools. As a defense against unauthorized third parties misleading GHCup into installing malicious software, GHCup supports checking that these metadata files are signed by a trusted [GPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard) key. This error occurs when GHCup was asked to verify all downloaded YAML files via GPG. E.g.

```
$ ghcup --gpg strict list

```

## Troubleshooting
First, make sure the remote file exists. It's name is the same as the YAML file, except it ends with `.sig`. For example:

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haskell/ghcup-metadata/master/ghcup-0.0.7.yaml
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haskell/ghcup-metadata/master/ghcup-0.0.7.yaml.sig

Then make sure you have the required GPG public keys: https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/guide/#gpg-verification

Finally, run `ghcup` with `-v` to see the exact `gpg` error, which can be used to diagnose why verification is failing. For example, if the key has not been imported, GPG will fail with the following message:

```
$ ghcup -v --gpg strict list
