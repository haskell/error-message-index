title: Overlapping Instances
summary: Multiple type class instances are resolved for a single type class method call.
severity: error
introduced: 9.6.1
---

Type class methods that make use of
[overlapping instances](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1/docs/users_guide/exts/instances.html#overlapping-instances)
lead may lead to an error because the resolved candidates would lead to indeterministic program behavior.

We can solve this by annotating the instances with the `{-# OVERLAPS #-}`, `{-# OVERLAPPING #-}`, `{-# OVERLAPPABLE #-}` and `{-# INCOHERENT #-}` pragma.
The former three can only be used if instances are *strictly more specific* than one another, i.e. the type of an instance can be substituted for the type of another instance.

Note that `{-# INCOHERENT #-}` still leads to indeterministic behavior and thus should be used with caution.
